# Low-level programming, Algorithm and Data Structure

Repository contain all projects and tasks during journey of learning C programming language.
Inside the repository folder each directory is topic i learned inside each directory there is multiple task each task has it's specific requirements which described in README of directory
This journey of learning C programming language contain serveral topics starting from basics to advanced including:
basics, functions, debugging, pointers, arrays, static and dynamic library, mmemory locations, structure and more.
Also include Data structure topic in details single linked list, double linked list, queue, stacks, hash table and more.
